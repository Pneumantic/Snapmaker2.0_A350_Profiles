Hello!

The files in this folder are specifically for the Cura slicer for the Snapmaker 2.0 A350 model. The speeds vary, use at your own risk. These are proven to work well,
just make sure that you are properly leveled beforehand. DO NOT increase the retraction speed by too much (10 mm/s is about fine). You should be able to use this for 
larger nozzles if you increase the heat a bit. This was set for Prusa filament so it is subject to change if you have a different type. More than likely this will not
work well with things like PETG or ABS as it has too fast of an initial layer. Slow down for your requirements. Enjoy!

Ninjaflex:
  If you are using the ninjaflex profile, the profile is set for relatively high speed at a .4mm extrusion width. This is NOT capable with a .4mm nozzle, you will need a 
  .6mm nozzle. You can change the width to .2mm or .3mm for capability with a .4mm nozzle. The heat as is sits quite high, so if you decide to change the width lower 
  down the heat with .2mm being the lowest heat level (~245-255). Note the thicker your are, the hotter it requires to conduct heat and since this system is direct drive 
  it is hard to go any faster than used because of the filament flexing and wrapping around your extrusion stepper. If you have issues with the extruder, either raise 
  your heat, give a greater z offset (TPU needs more space on the bed to expand, PLA is stiff so it can take the higher backpressure), or slow down your speeds.

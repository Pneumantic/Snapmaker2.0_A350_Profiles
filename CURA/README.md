Hello!

The files in this folder are specifically for the Cura slicer for the Snapmaker 2.0 A350 model. The speeds vary, use at your own risk. These are proven to work well,
just make sure that you are properly leveled beforehand. DO NOT increase the retraction speed by too much (10 mm/s is about fine). You should be able to use this for 
larger nozzles if you increase the heat a bit. This was set for Prusa filament so it is subject to change if you have a different type. More than likely this will not
work well with things like PETG or ABS as it has too fast of an initial layer. Slow down for your requirements. Enjoy!

P.S. The high-speed profile is Prusa PLA Galaxy black at 140mm/s

Ninjaflex:

  If you are using the ninjaflex profile, the profile is set for relatively high speed at a .4mm extrusion width. This is NOT capable with a .4mm nozzle, you will need a 
  .6mm nozzle. You can change the width to .2mm or .3mm for capability with a .4mm nozzle. The heat as is sits quite high, so if you decide to change the width lower 
  down the heat with .2mm being the lowest heat level (~245-255). Note the thicker your are, the hotter it requires to conduct heat and since this system is direct drive 
  it is hard to go any faster than used because of the filament flexing and wrapping around your extrusion stepper. If you have issues with the extruder, either raise 
  your heat, give a greater z offset (TPU needs more space on the bed to expand, PLA is stiff so it can take the higher backpressure), or slow down your speeds. 

Overature PETG (Translucent and Black)
 
 I have noticed that the PETG that Overature uses requires quite the bit of heat. For this profile your printer will need your bed at 80 degrees and your nozzle at 275. 
 With PETG be careful as the brand types vary quite the bit depending on the mixture that they use. Pure filaments are not that great alone, so many companies do lace 
 their filament with a bit of others to assist with printing and strength. Different colors can have different affects depending upon the minerals used to create the 
 color. Due note that due to PETG's high heat and stringyness, you want higher speeds to print this. The files will be labled with their corresponding speeds. You DO NOT 
 WANT to turn on your nozzle cooling fan with PETG. Doing so will decrease the strength of PETG layer adhesion resulting in brittler parts. This profile prints very 
 well, even better so than PLA. You can go down in layer size without adjusting any of the other settings. I have done a lot of honing to these profiles so they should 
 require much work. 
 
 BIG NOTE: OVERATURE has a very big issue with hydroscopic decay. I definitely recommend drying even after opening you fresh role and prior to every use.

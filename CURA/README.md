Hello!

The files in this folder are specifically for the Cura slicer for the Snapmaker 2.0 A350 model. The speeds vary, use at your own risk. These are proven to work well,
just make sure that you are properly leveled beforehand. DO NOT increase the retraction speed by too much (10 mm/s is about fine). You should be able to use this for 
larger nozzles if you increase the heat a bit. This was set for Prusa filament so it is subject to change if you have a different type. More than likely this will not
work well with things like PETG or ABS as it has too fast of an initial layer. Slow down for your requirements. Enjoy!
